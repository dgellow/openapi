Go to https://editor.swagger.io/ and under `File`, click `Import file` to import the `playground_openapi_specs.yaml` file, or just paste the yaml contents into the text editor on the left.

Copy paste your `TOGETHER_API_KEY` into the `Authorize` button on the upper right, once you see the lock go from unlocked to locked, this will turn your YAML file into a working control panel that lets you make requests to our Together API.
